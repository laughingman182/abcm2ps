		--- abcm2ps installation ---


Unix(-like) systems
===================

This version does not use the GNU 'autoconf' package anymore.

The furnished 'Makefile' should work as it is for most systems.
So, simply do

	make

and then, as root, do:

	make install

If you are not happy with the Makefile options (install programm,
installation directories..), you may create a file 'custom' with
your own values (Bourne shell syntax) and use the script 'configure'
to create an other Makefile.
The variables which may be customized are at the head of the script
configure. For example, if you prefer to use 'clang' instead of 'gcc',
the file 'custom' would contain the single line

	CC=clang

then, you do

	./configure
	make

Without a file 'custom', you may do the same with

	./configure --CC=clang

If you want to use the 'pango' library, this one is not enabled
by default in the Makefile and you should use script 'configure'
to include it in the Makefile.


Windows or MAC systems
======================

Change the file 'config.h' according to your preferences, compile all
the '.c' files using an ANSI C compiler, and link them together.
The resulting binary file should run immediately from where it has been
generated. You may then move it at any place you want.

Note: I don't know how to do file mapping (mmap) in ms-windows, so,
you must comment 'HAVE_MMAP' in config.h.


Testing
=======

To test the program, run it with one of the .abc files as the command
line argument:

	abcm2ps sample

The resulting file, 'Out.ps', may be displayed using a PostScript
previewer such as ghostscript or zathura, or it may be sent directly
to a PostScript printer, or indirectly to a simple printer using
a postscript filter.


About the 'pango' library
=========================

abcm2ps may use the 'pango' library to render texts with non latin
characters on PostScript output. If you have no such texts or
if you do only SVG/(X)HTML output, you don't need this library.

In Unix(-like) systems, at configure time, the pango generation elements
are searched by pkg-config in the gdk-2.0 library. If this library or
pkg_config are not found, the rendering of non latin characters with
pango will be disabled, but this rendering may be done by other means,
especially by CMap (see the file chinese.abc). Note also that, when
pango is defined, it may be disabled at command line level by
'--pango 0'.
